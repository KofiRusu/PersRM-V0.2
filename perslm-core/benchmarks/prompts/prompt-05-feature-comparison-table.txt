Create a feature comparison table for a project management SaaS application that compares three subscription tiers: Basic, Pro, and Enterprise. The table should:

- Display features in rows and plans in columns
- Include at least 15 features spanning categories like:
  * Task Management (task creation, assignment, subtasks, etc.)
  * Collaboration (commenting, file sharing, @mentions, etc.)
  * Reporting (basic reports, custom reports, data export, etc.)
  * Integrations (number of integrations, API access, etc.)
  * Security (2FA, SSO, audit logs, etc.)
  * Support (response time, support channels, etc.)

- Clearly mark which features are available in which plans using checkmarks, "x" marks, or similar indicators
- Use visual styling to highlight the Pro plan as recommended
- Include sticky/fixed column headers for better usability on mobile
- Be fully responsive, adapting to various screen sizes
- Have an accessible design with proper heading structure and ARIA attributes
- Include hover states for better readability
- Use a color scheme that provides sufficient contrast

The table should be designed to make it easy for potential customers to compare features across different plans at a glance.
