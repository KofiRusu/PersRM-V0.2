- An overview section with summary cards showing critical KPIs
- Interactive line and bar charts for trend analysis with customizable date ranges
- Filterable data tables with sorting, pagination, and export capabilities
- Geo-visualization map showing regional performance metrics
- User-configurable dashboard layout with drag-and-drop widget positioning
- Dark/light theme toggle for different viewing environments
- Real-time data updates with subtle loading indicators
- Responsive design that adapts to different screen sizes
- Drill-down capability to explore data in greater detail
- Alert indicators for metrics outside of expected ranges
- Data insights panel with AI-generated observations about trends
- Customizable threshold settings for various metrics
- Easy sharing options for reports (PDF, image export, URL sharing)
- Accessible design with proper color contrast, keyboard navigation, and screen reader support

The dashboard should load efficiently, handle large datasets gracefully, and provide intuitive controls for filtering and customization.
