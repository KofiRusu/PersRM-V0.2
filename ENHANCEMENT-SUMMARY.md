# PersLM Task Monitor Enhancement Summary

## Overview
We've successfully enhanced the PersLM Task Monitor with advanced features for better task management, improved UI/UX, and expanded functionality. The implementation includes both React components for the Next.js application and a standalone Express server for testing outside the application context.

## Key Enhancements

### UI Components
1. **Enhanced TaskMonitorProvider**
   - Added support for task tags and priorities
   - Implemented task details management
   - Added date tracking (created, updated, start, completion)
   - Implemented state persistence with localStorage

2. **Improved TaskMonitor Component**
   - Added selection functionality for batch operations
   - Enhanced task display with tags and priorities
   - Implemented detailed task editing via modal
   - Added formatted date display

3. **Advanced PersLMTaskMonitor**
   - Added tabbed interface for tasks and statistics
   - Implemented search and filtering capabilities
   - Added batch operations interface
   - Enhanced status displays and task metrics
   - Added toast notifications for user feedback

### Server Implementation
- Created a standalone HTTP server for testing
- Implemented RESTful API endpoints:
  - GET /api/tasks - Retrieve all tasks
  - POST /api/tasks - Create a new task
  - PUT /api/tasks/:id - Update a task
  - DELETE /api/tasks/:id - Delete a task
- Added in-memory task storage with sample data
- Implemented robust error handling

### Feature Highlights
- **Batch Operations**: Select multiple tasks and change their status all at once
- **Priority Levels**: Assign low, medium, high priority to tasks
- **Tagging System**: Organize tasks with multiple tags
- **Detailed Task Information**: Add notes and context to tasks
- **Time Tracking**: Automatically track when tasks are started and completed
- **Statistics**: View completion metrics and performance insights
- **Search & Filtering**: Find tasks by status, description, or tags
- **Toast Notifications**: Get feedback on task actions

## Files Created/Modified
1. `components/TaskMonitorProvider.tsx` - Context provider for task state management
2. `components/TaskMonitor.tsx` - Main component for displaying tasks
3. `components/PersLMTaskMonitor.tsx` - Enhanced implementation with floating UI
4. `components/ui/badge.tsx` - UI component for displaying tags
5. `pages/task-monitor-demo.tsx` - Next.js demo page
6. `run-task-monitor.js` - Standalone HTTP server
7. `TASK-MONITOR.md` - Documentation for the Task Monitor

## How to Use
### Running the Standalone Server
```bash
node run-task-monitor.js
```
This will start the server at http://localhost:3001

### Next.js Integration
The Task Monitor is available as a Next.js page at `/task-monitor-demo` when running the Next.js development server:
```bash
npm run dev
```

## Next Steps
1. **Integration**: Fully integrate the Task Monitor with other PersLM modules
2. **Backend Connection**: Connect to a persistent database instead of in-memory storage
3. **Advanced Filtering**: Implement more advanced filtering and sorting options
4. **Keyboard Shortcuts**: Add keyboard shortcuts for common actions
5. **Team Collaboration**: Add features for team collaboration on tasks
6. **Mobile Optimization**: Further enhance the mobile experience
