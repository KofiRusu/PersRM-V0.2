# PersLM Reasoning System

The PersLM reasoning system provides advanced reasoning capabilities that enable the model to solve complex problems through structured thought processes. This document explains the reasoning architecture, available reasoning modes, and how to use and extend the system.

## Overview

The reasoning system in PersLM allows the model to engage in different types of reasoning processes to tackle complex problems in a systematic way. By structuring the reasoning process, the model can break down complex problems, explore multiple approaches, reflect on its own reasoning, and generate more accurate and reliable solutions.

Key features of the reasoning system:
- Multiple reasoning strategies optimized for different types of tasks
- Traceability through detailed reasoning traces
- Integration with the memory system for persistent context
- Evaluation metrics to assess reasoning quality
- Extensible architecture for adding new reasoning modes

## Reasoning Modes

PersLM supports the following reasoning modes:

### Chain of Thought (CoT)
Chain of Thought reasoning enables the model to solve problems step-by-step, breaking down complex reasoning into a series of intermediate steps. This approach is particularly effective for:
- Mathematical problems
- Logical reasoning
- Sequential processes
- Problems that benefit from explicit intermediate steps

Example:
```
Question: If a store offers a 25% discount on a $120 item during a sale, and then applies a 10% coupon on the discounted price, what is the final price?

Let me think through this step by step:
1. First, I'll calculate the price after the 25% discount.
   The discount amount is $120 × 0.25 = $30
   The discounted price is $120 - $30 = $90

2. Next, I'll apply the 10% coupon to the discounted price.
   The coupon discount amount is $90 × 0.10 = $9
   The final price is $90 - $9 = $81

Therefore, the final price of the item after both discounts is $81.
```

### Self-Reflection
Self-Reflection reasoning enables the model to generate an initial response, critically examine it, and then improve it. This approach is particularly effective for:
- Complex essay writing
- Checking for errors or biases
- Improving comprehensiveness of answers
- Ensuring balanced analysis

Example:
```
Question: What are the environmental impacts of electric vehicles?

Initial response:
Electric vehicles are better for the environment because they don't produce emissions when driving. They run on electricity instead of gasoline, which makes them cleaner.

Reflection:
My initial response is too simplistic and one-sided. I didn't acknowledge that while EVs don't produce tailpipe emissions, they still have environmental impacts through their production, electricity generation, and battery disposal. I should provide a more balanced and comprehensive analysis.

Improved answer:
Electric vehicles have several environmental impacts, both positive and negative:

Positive impacts:
- No direct tailpipe emissions, reducing local air pollution
- Lower overall greenhouse gas emissions compared to conventional vehicles (when powered by low-carbon electricity)
- Higher energy efficiency compared to internal combustion engines

Negative impacts:
- Manufacturing EVs, especially their batteries, can be resource-intensive and energy-intensive
- Environmental impact depends heavily on the source of electricity (coal-powered electricity reduces their benefit)
- Battery production requires mining of materials like lithium, cobalt, and nickel, which has environmental consequences
- End-of-life battery disposal or recycling presents challenges

Overall, studies suggest that EVs typically have a lower lifetime environmental impact than conventional vehicles, but the complete picture requires consideration of the full lifecycle and local energy grid composition.

### Task Decomposition
Task Decomposition reasoning breaks down complex tasks into smaller, more manageable subtasks. This approach is particularly effective for:
- Multi-step projects
- Research planning
- Complex workflows
- Large tasks requiring organization

Example:
```
Task: Create a comprehensive marketing strategy for a new mobile app.

Task Decomposition:
1. Market Research
   - Identify target audience demographics and preferences
   - Analyze competitors and their marketing strategies
   - Determine market size and growth potential
   - Identify key market trends and user needs

2. Product Positioning
   - Define unique value proposition
   - Develop key messaging and app description
   - Determine pricing strategy (if applicable)
   - Identify competitive advantages

3. Marketing Channels
   - Evaluate social media platforms for audience reach
   - Assess paid advertising options (Google Ads, Meta, TikTok, etc.)
   - Consider App Store Optimization (ASO) strategies
   - Explore content marketing and PR opportunities

4. Campaign Planning
   - Set marketing goals and KPIs
   - Develop marketing calendar/timeline
   - Plan launch campaign
   - Design ongoing marketing activities

5. Budget Allocation
   - Estimate costs for each marketing activity
   - Prioritize channels based on expected ROI
   - Develop budget monitoring system

6. Analytics and Iteration
   - Set up tracking and attribution
   - Plan for A/B testing of marketing messages
   - Establish reporting framework
   - Create process for strategy refinement
```

### Planning
Planning reasoning creates a strategic plan with steps, considerations, and contingencies. This approach is particularly effective for:
- Strategic planning
- Process optimization
- Decision-making frameworks
- Outcome optimization

Example:
```
Problem: How can a small restaurant increase revenue during slow weekday evenings?

Strategic Plan:

1. Data Collection and Analysis
   - Review sales data to identify specific slow periods
   - Analyze customer demographics during weekdays vs. weekends
   - Survey existing customers about weekday preferences
   - Research what competitors do during weekday evenings

2. Special Offerings Development
   - Create weekday-only menu specials (e.g., "Tuesday Tasting Menu")
   - Develop happy hour drink and appetizer promotions
   - Design family meal deals specifically for weekday evenings
   - Consider special themed evenings (trivia night, live music, etc.)

3. Marketing Strategy
   - Targeted social media campaigns highlighting weekday specials
   - Email marketing to existing customers about new offerings
   - Local advertising focusing on weekday promotions
   - Loyalty program with extra points/rewards for weekday visits

4. Operational Adjustments
   - Optimize staffing levels for weekday evenings
   - Train staff to promote specials and increase check sizes
   - Adjust inventory management for special weekday offerings
   - Consider modified hours if certain hours are consistently unprofitable

5. Partnership Opportunities
   - Connect with nearby businesses for cross-promotion
   - Partner with local event spaces for pre/post-event dining
   - Consider delivery platform promotions specific to weekday evenings

6. Implementation Timeline
   - Week 1-2: Data collection and analysis
   - Week 3-4: Develop offerings and marketing materials
   - Week 5: Staff training and operational preparations
   - Week 6: Launch initial weekday promotions
   - Week 10: Evaluate results and refine strategy
```

## Using the Reasoning System

### Basic Usage

To use the reasoning system, you need to:

1. Initialize the reasoning manager
2. Register the desired reasoners
3. Call the `reason` method with your query

Example:
```python
from src.reasoning import ReasoningManager, ReasoningMode
from src.reasoning.chain_of_thought import ChainOfThoughtReasoner

# Initialize reasoning manager with a model text generation function
def generate_text(prompt):
    # This would call your actual model
    return model.generate(prompt)

reasoning_manager = ReasoningManager(model_provider=generate_text)

# Register a reasoner
reasoning_manager.register_reasoner(
    ReasoningMode.CHAIN_OF_THOUGHT, 
    ChainOfThoughtReasoner()
)

# Use the reasoner
result = reasoning_manager.reason(
    query="If a train travels at 120 kilometers per hour, how far will it travel in 2.5 hours?",
    mode=ReasoningMode.CHAIN_OF_THOUGHT
)

# Get the result
print(result["result"]["answer"])  # Answer derived from the reasoning process
print(result["trace"].get_full_trace())  # Full reasoning trace
```

### Integration with Training Pipeline

The reasoning system integrates with the training pipeline to enable fine-tuning on reasoning traces:

```bash
# Evaluate reasoning on a benchmark dataset
python src/train.py \
  --enable_reasoning \
  --reasoning_benchmark gsm8k \
  --eval_reasoning \
  --save_evaluation_results

# Train with reasoning traces
python src/train.py \
  --enable_reasoning \
  --reasoning_benchmark gsm8k \
  --train_with_reasoning \
  --num_epochs 3
```

### Extending with New Reasoners

To create a new reasoner:

1. Create a new class that implements the reasoning interface
2. Register it with the reasoning manager

Example:
```python
class MyCustomReasoner:
    def __init__(self, config=None):
        self.config = config or {}
    
    def reason(self, query, context=None, trace=None, model_provider=None, max_iterations=3):
        # Implement your reasoning logic here
        # Use model_provider to generate text when needed
        # Use trace to record the reasoning process
        
        return {
            "answer": "The answer based on my reasoning",
            "additional_info": "Any additional information"
        }
```

## Evaluation & Metrics

The reasoning system provides evaluation metrics to assess the quality of reasoning:

- For Chain of Thought: quality of steps, presence of calculations, explicit steps
- For Self-Reflection: identification of issues, significance of improvements
- For Task Decomposition: number of tasks, sequence clarity, dependency mapping
- For Planning: comprehensiveness, execution details, contingency plans

## Advanced Features

### Memory Integration

The reasoning system integrates with the memory system to store and retrieve reasoning traces:

```python
# Save a reasoning trace to memory
reasoning_result = reasoning_manager.reason(query="...", save_to_memory=True)

# Later, retrieve similar reasoning traces
memory_results = memory_manager.search(query="...", metadata_filter={"type": "reasoning_trace"})
```

### Hybrid Reasoning

The reasoning system can automatically select the most appropriate reasoning mode:

```python
# Let the system choose the best reasoning mode
result = reasoning_manager.reason(query="...", mode=ReasoningMode.AUTO)
```

### Reasoning Feedback

The reasoning system can be fine-tuned using feedback on reasoning traces:

```python
# Evaluate a reasoning trace
evaluation = reasoner.evaluate(reasoning_trace)

# Use the evaluation for feedback in training
feedback = {
    "trace_id": trace_id,
    "quality": evaluation["quality"],
    "feedback": evaluation["message"],
    "improvements": ["Be more explicit in step 2", "Show calculation in step 3"]
}
```

## Best Practices

1. **Task-Specific Reasoning**: Choose the appropriate reasoning mode for the task at hand
2. **Iteration**: For complex problems, use multiple iterations of reasoning
3. **Context**: Provide relevant context when available to improve reasoning quality
4. **Evaluation**: Regularly evaluate reasoning quality using the provided metrics
5. **Memory**: Leverage the memory system to build on previous reasoning traces

## Future Developments

Future enhancements to the reasoning system include:
- **Multi-step reasoning**: Combining different reasoning modes for complex problems
- **External tool integration**: Using tools within the reasoning process
- **Collaborative reasoning**: Enabling multiple agents to reason together
- **Reasoning with uncertainty**: Explicitly handling uncertainty in the reasoning process
