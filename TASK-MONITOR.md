# PersLM Task Monitor

The PersLM Task Monitor is an enhanced task tracking system designed for Phase 2 of the PersLM project. It provides a comprehensive UI for managing implementation tasks with advanced features for better organization and productivity.

## Features

### Core Features
- **Task Management**: Create, edit, and delete tasks with detailed information
- **Status Tracking**: Track task status (pending, in-progress, completed, failed)
- **Batch Operations**: Select and update multiple tasks at once
- **Filtering & Search**: Find tasks by status, description, or tags
- **Statistics & Analytics**: View completion metrics and performance insights
- **Persistence**: All tasks are stored in browser localStorage for continuity

### Enhanced Features
- **Priority Levels**: Assign low, medium, or high priority to tasks
- **Tagging System**: Organize tasks with multiple tags
- **Detailed Task Information**: Add notes and contextual details to tasks
- **Time Tracking**: Automatically track when tasks are started and completed
- **Toast Notifications**: Get feedback on task actions
- **Responsive Design**: Works well on both desktop and mobile devices
- **Keyboard Shortcuts**: Improve productivity with keyboard navigation

## UI Components

The Task Monitor is built with modular React components:

1. **TaskMonitorProvider.tsx**: Context provider for task state management
   - Manages the task data store
   - Provides actions for CRUD operations
   - Handles data persistence via localStorage
   - Calculates task statistics

2. **TaskMonitor.tsx**: Main component for displaying tasks
   - Renders task list with status indicators
   - Handles status toggling and selection
   - Supports detailed task editing
   - Shows task metadata (tags, priority, timestamps)

3. **PersLMTaskMonitor.tsx**: Enhanced implementation
   - Adds floating UI with notifications counter
   - Provides tabbed interface for tasks and statistics
   - Implements batch operations interface
   - Adds filtering and search capabilities

## API Endpoints

The Express server provides a complete REST API for task management:

- `GET /api/tasks`: Retrieve all tasks
- `POST /api/tasks`: Create a new task
- `PUT /api/tasks/:id`: Update an existing task
- `DELETE /api/tasks/:id`: Remove a task

## Usage

### Running the Server
```bash
node run-task-monitor.js
```
This will start the server at http://localhost:3001

### Next.js Integration
The Task Monitor is also available as a Next.js page at `/task-monitor-demo` when running the Next.js development server:

```bash
npm run dev
```

## Implementation Details

### Task Data Structure
```typescript
interface Task {
  id: string;
  description: string;
  status: 'pending' | 'in-progress' | 'completed' | 'failed';
  startTime?: Date;
  completionTime?: Date;
  tags?: string[];
  details?: string;
  priority?: 'low' | 'medium' | 'high';
  createdAt: Date;
  updatedAt: Date;
}
```

### Technology Stack
- **React**: UI components and hooks
- **TailwindCSS**: Styling and responsive design
- **Shadcn/UI**: Component library and styling system
- **Express**: API server (for standalone mode)
- **Next.js**: Framework integration (for full mode)

## Future Enhancements
- Integration with authentication system
- Team collaboration features
- Advanced filtering and sorting options
- Custom task templates
- Automated reporting
- Integration with other PersLM modules
