# PersLM Personalization System

This document describes the personalization capabilities of the PersLM system, which enable the model to adapt to individual users based on their preferences, traits, behaviors, and contexts.

## Overview

The personalization system consists of several integrated components:

1. **User Profiles**: Core data structures for representing user preferences, traits, and knowledge
2. **Adaptation**: Mechanisms for adjusting model behavior based on profiles
3. **Context Awareness**: Collecting and utilizing contextual information
4. **Memory Integration**: Personalizing based on interaction history
5. **Feedback Loop**: Learning and improving from user interactions

## User Profiles

User profiles are comprehensive representations of users that capture:

- **Preferences**: User-specific settings and preferences
- **Traits**: Characteristics and attributes of the user
- **Knowledge Areas**: Topics and domains the user has knowledge in
- **Goals**: User's short and long-term objectives
- **Interaction History**: Record of past interactions

Profiles are persistent across sessions and continuously update as the system learns more about the user.

### Profile Storage

Profiles can be stored in different formats:

- **JSON Storage**: File-based persistence
- **Memory Storage**: In-memory storage for testing or ephemeral use
- **Database Storage**: For production environments (planned)

## Adaptation Mechanisms

The adaptation system modifies model outputs according to user preferences using several strategies:

### Content Personalization

Adjusts information based on user knowledge level and preferences:

- For experts: Uses more technical language and dives deeper
- For beginners: Adds more explanations and uses simpler terminology
- References prior conversations when relevant

### Style Adaptation

Matches communication style to user preferences:

- Adjusts conciseness based on preference for brief vs. detailed responses
- Modifies formality level (casual vs. formal tone)
- Adapts to other stylistic preferences

### Complexity Adaptation

Tailors the complexity of explanations:

- Adjusts vocabulary complexity
- Modifies sentence structure and readability
- Changes explanation depth based on user's preferred complexity level

### Interest-Based Prioritization

Emphasizes content related to user interests:

- Highlights topics the user has shown interest in
- Gives more prominence to high-interest areas
- Re-orders information to prioritize relevant content

### Context-Aware Responses

Adapts to situational context:

- Time-based adaptations (morning, afternoon, evening)
- Device-specific optimizations (mobile vs. desktop)
- Location-based customizations
- Session and activity context

## Adaptive Learning

The system improves personalization over time through:

1. **Explicit Feedback**: Direct user input on preferences and response quality
2. **Implicit Feedback**: Learning from user behavior and interactions
3. **Strategy Adjustment**: Automatically adjusting adaptation strategies based on effectiveness

## Configuration

The personalization system is highly configurable through `configs/personalization.yaml`:

- Enable/disable specific adaptation strategies
- Adjust weights and thresholds for each strategy
- Configure context collection parameters
- Set up profile storage options
- Control memory integration settings

## Integration with the Model

The personalization system integrates with the core PersLM model through:

1. **Pre-processing**: Providing context and user information before generation
2. **Post-processing**: Adapting generated responses before delivery
3. **Learning Loop**: Feeding back interaction data to improve personalization

## Example Usage

```python
from src.personalization import personalization_manager

# Get user profile
user_id = "user123"
profile = personalization_manager.get_profile(user_id)

# Personalize a response
original_response = "This is the model's original response."
user_query = "Tell me about machine learning."
context = {"device_type": "mobile", "time_of_day": "evening"}

personalized_response = personalization_manager.personalize_response(
    user_id=user_id,
    response=original_response,
    query=user_query, 
    context=context
)

# Process user feedback
feedback_data = {
    "preferences": {
        "conciseness": 0.8  # User prefers concise responses
    }
}
personalization_manager.process_feedback(
    user_id=user_id,
    feedback_type="preference_feedback",
    feedback_data=feedback_data
)
```

## Future Enhancements

Planned improvements to the personalization system:

1. **Multi-modal Personalization**: Extending adaptation to images, audio, and other modalities
2. **Group Personalization**: Adapting to groups and communities
3. **Privacy-Preserving Personalization**: Enhancing privacy controls and local personalization
4. **Cross-Device Synchronization**: Seamless profile sharing across devices
5. **Cultural Adaptation**: More sophisticated cultural and regional adaptations
