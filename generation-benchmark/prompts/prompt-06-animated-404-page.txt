Create a visually engaging and interactive 404 error page that:

- Features a creative animation that illustrates the concept of a missing page
- Includes a brief, friendly error message explaining that the page cannot be found
- Provides helpful navigation options back to functional parts of the site (home page, search, sitemap, etc.)
- Has a search box to help users find what they were looking for
- Incorporates subtle interaction effects (hover states, mouse-follow elements, etc.)
- Uses motion that respects user preferences (reduced motion settings)
- Is fully responsive across all device sizes
- Maintains brand consistency with the rest of the site
- Includes appropriate ARIA attributes and keyboard navigation for accessibility
- Loads quickly and doesn't impact performance
- Uses creative illustrations or imagery that makes the error experience less frustrating

The 404 page should turn a potentially negative user experience into a memorable and helpful interaction that guides users back to valuable content.
