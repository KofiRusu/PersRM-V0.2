Create a contact form that allows users to send inquiries to a business. The form should:

- Include the following fields:
  * Full Name (required)
  * Email Address (required, with validation)
  * Phone Number (optional)
  * Subject (dropdown with options: General Inquiry, Support, Sales, Partnership)
  * Message (textarea, required, with character count)
  * File attachment (optional, accept documents and images only, max size 5MB)
  * Checkbox for subscribing to newsletter
  * Checkbox for agreeing to privacy policy (required)

- Validate inputs in real-time with helpful error messages
- Show a loading state during submission (use a non-intrusive spinner with text feedback)
- Display success and error states after submission
- Be fully responsive on all devices (mobile-first approach)
- Include proper labels and placeholder text

Accessibility Requirements:
- Implement proper semantic HTML5 structure (form, fieldset, legend as appropriate)
- Include visible labels for all form controls (no placeholder-only labels)
- Add specific ARIA attributes (aria-required, aria-describedby, aria-live for dynamic content)
- Ensure 3:1 minimum contrast ratio for all text and form controls
- Provide keyboard navigation with visible focus states
- Implement error handling that works with screen readers (aria-invalid, error messages linked to fields)
- Add skip navigation for screen reader users if the form is lengthy

UX Polish Guidelines:
- Implement progressive disclosure for complex fields (e.g., file upload with preview)
- Add micro-interactions on focus, hover, and successful validation (subtle color changes, icons)
- Use consistent spacing between form elements (recommend 16-24px vertical spacing)
- Show inline validation with both color and icon indicators (not just red/green)
- Implement auto-formatting for phone fields as user types
- Design a multi-step submission flow if the form is lengthy
- Clearly indicate required vs. optional fields (use "(optional)" text rather than asterisks)

Expected Layout:
- Single column layout on mobile for better focus and reduced cognitive load
- Two-column layout option for desktop with logical grouping of related fields
- Submit button should be full-width on mobile, appropriately sized on desktop
- Error messages should appear directly below the relevant field
- Success message should replace the form or appear as a prominent notification

Reference Examples:
- For form layout inspiration, see Stripe's contact form (https://stripe.com/contact) 
- For accessibility implementation, reference Mailchimp's signup forms
- For error handling, consider the pattern used by gov.uk forms

The form should handle errors gracefully and guide users to correct any issues before submission. Consider implementing a "save draft" feature for complex forms to prevent data loss.
