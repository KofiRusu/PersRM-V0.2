Create a hero section for a SaaS product called "DataVista" that helps businesses visualize complex data.

The hero should include:
- A headline that communicates the core value proposition
- A supporting subheadline that explains benefits 
- Two CTAs: "Start Free Trial" (primary) and "Watch Demo" (secondary)
- A modern illustration or image placeholder on the right side
- A small "Trusted by" logo section with 4-5 placeholder company logos

The hero should be designed to capture attention, clearly communicate the product's value, and drive conversions. Make it responsive and ensure proper contrast for accessibility.

Implement subtle animations or transitions that enhance the user experience without being distracting.
