# AUTONOMOUS MULTI-AGENT INITIALIZATION

## üîÅ SHARED GOAL:
Establish a multi-agent autonomous loop across the ReasoningAssistant, PersLM system, and ChatGPT session to collaboratively execute, validate, and complete the full Reasoning Assistant development roadmap.

## üß† PARTICIPATING AGENTS:
- ReasoningAssistant (implements UI/UX, components, routes)
- PersLM (validates, benchmarks, adapts)
- ChatGPT (strategy, record-keeping, prompt relay)

## ü§© COMMUNICATION PROTOCOL:
All agents will communicate via this file. Tasks are assigned in markdown blocks using this format:

```md
### TASK-ID: <UUID or task name>
role: ReasoningAssistant
status: pending
initiator: ChatGPT
description: Generate a Reasoning Toggle component with ARIA and persistence
result: (left blank until complete)
```

## ‚úÖ SYSTEM VALIDATION PROTOCOL (Before and After Each Step):
1. PersLM must run system-wide validation:
   - Linting, TypeScript type-check
   - Functionality test of previous features
   - UI visual smoke test (dark/light mode, drag, copy, tab switching)
   - Ensure logging/analytics pipeline is functional
2. Only if all above tests pass, allow next task execution.
3. Post-task, re-run the same validation with change-specific checks.

## ‚öíÔ∏è EXECUTION STRATEGY:
- ReasoningAssistant will only take tasks labeled role: ReasoningAssistant and write back status and code results in the result field.
- PersLM will monitor and validate every result block.
- ChatGPT may append tasks or modify strategy via comments.
- All prompt chains will end when #ALL TASKS COMPLETE is logged at the bottom of the file.

## üåü TERMINATION CONDITION:
The loop will only terminate when all features and enhancements from the following roadmap are completed, validated, and reviewed:
1. Core UI toggle system with context and persistence
2. Keyboard shortcut (‚åò+K / Ctrl+K) integration
3. Framer Motion animations for assistant panel
4. Assistant open/close event logging (RetentionService)
5. API logging endpoint with metadata tagging
6. Analytics dashboard for assistant usage
7. A/B testing infrastructure for animation variants
8. Prompt success tracking via ranking + logs
9. Assistant auto-adaptation based on usage patterns
10. Validation hook after every assistant action
11. Self-improvement pipeline via RetentionService logs
12. Final staging readiness and production-level performance checks
