# ‚úÖ PersLM.UIUX ‚Äî Development Checkpoint

### üìå Current State of the Project
PersLM.UIUX currently exists as a conceptual framework. The core plugin system has been established, which will serve as the foundation for the UI/UX components. The plugin architecture enables modular development of UI components and interaction patterns. A calendar integration plugin has been implemented as an example, which demonstrates integration capabilities with external services.

### üß† Recent Progress and Achievements
- Designed and implemented a complete multi-step user registration flow
- Used `UXFlowDesigner` for interaction design across 4 registration steps
- Applied `ComponentSynthesizer` to generate React + Tailwind + shadcn/ui components
- Maintained design consistency using `DesignSystemMapper`
- Achieved a11y compliance using `AccessibilityEvaluator`
- Documented decisions and UX tradeoffs with `RationaleEngine`
- Implemented a parent flow manager (`RegistrationFlow.tsx`) for orchestration
- Used React Hook Form + Zod for schema-driven validation
- Integrated step indicators, back/edit logic, and responsive UI
- Ensured production-readiness across accessibility, state, and design criteria
- Initialized `ThemingEngine` to manage persistent design tokens and apply styles across components and flows
- Defined structure for `theme/index.ts`, `theme/tokens.json`, and Tailwind plugin integration
- Enabled runtime theming with support for brand-specific overrides
- Planned future enhancements:
  - `extractFromFigma()` for token import
  - Visual theme editor UI
  - Component-level theming overrides
  - Tailwind plugin generator
  - CSS-in-JS bridge (e.g., Emotion, Styled Components)

### üéØ Current Focus Areas
- Plugin system refinement
- UI/UX component architecture design
- User interaction patterns through plugins
- Integration strategy between UI layer and underlying capabilities
- Design system integration and theming capabilities
- Plugin-powered UI generation
- Visual UX tool integration

### ü™ú Next Steps
1. Design UI component plugin architecture (`plugins/ui/component_base.py`)
2. Create UI rendering pipeline (`plugins/ui/renderer.py`) 
3. Implement basic UI component plugins:
   - `plugins/ui/components/button.py`
   - `plugins/ui/components/card.py`
   - `plugins/ui/components/input.py`
4. Develop UI theming system (`plugins/ui/theming.py`)
5. Build integration between calendar plugin and UI components
6. Implement first reasoning module integrations in the UI plugin system
7. Create test cases to validate reasoning module outputs
8. Generate additional UI components for common use cases
9. Develop a component library documentation system
10. Implement additional multi-step flows (checkout, onboarding, etc.)
11. Expand ThemingEngine capabilities and integrations
12. Define plugin interface schema and create modular UI plugins
13. Develop integration pathways with visual tools like Figma or Framer

### üîó Dependencies & Environment
- Development Environment: macOS (darwin 24.0.0)
- Python environment with packages in `environment.yml`
- Google Calendar API for calendar plugin integration
- Potential frontend dependencies to be determined (React, Tailwind, etc.)
- Development tools: Cursor IDE with Claude 3.7 integration
- Shadcn/ui component library
- Tailwind CSS for styling
- React for frontend components
- Lucide for icons
- React Hook Form for form management
- Zod for form validation
- Next.js (optional) for routing

### üóÇÔ∏è Recent Files Worked On
- `components/registration/EmailPasswordForm.tsx`
- `components/registration/ProfileSetupForm.tsx`
- `components/registration/RoleSelectionForm.tsx`
- `components/registration/RegistrationReview.tsx`
- `components/registration/RegistrationFlow.tsx`
- `theme/index.ts`
- `theme/tokens.json`
- `theme/ThemeProvider.tsx`
- `components/Alert.tsx`

### üöÄ To Continue Development
1. Review the plugin system structure to understand the extension points
2. Design the UI component plugin architecture document
3. Implement the first UI component plugin to test the architecture
4. Create a simple UI demonstration using the calendar plugin as a data source
5. Define the interaction patterns between UI components and underlying plugins
6. Begin implementing the `LayoutInterpreter` reasoning module
7. Create a test harness for evaluating reasoning module outputs
8. Develop additional UI components using the established reasoning process
9. Create a component showcase application
10. Implement additional multi-step flows (checkout, onboarding, etc.)
11. Integrate the ThemingEngine with existing components
12. Develop the UI Plugin System for modular frontend generation
13. Build integration pathways with visual design tools
