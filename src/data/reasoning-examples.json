    "expected_reasoning": "When designing a user registration form for a SaaS project management platform, I need to consider several factors:\n\n1. Essential fields: The form should collect username, email, password (with confirmation), and optionally name or organization.\n\n2. Progressive disclosure: Since this is a project management tool, we shouldn't overwhelm new users with too many fields. Additional information like team size, role, and project preferences can be collected after the initial sign-up.\n\n3. Validation requirements: Email format validation, password strength requirements (8+ characters, special characters, numbers), and real-time validation feedback are essential.\n\n4. Authentication options: Offering social login (GitHub, Google) alongside traditional email/password would reduce friction for technical users.\n\n5. Security considerations: Ensuring password fields are properly masked, implementing CSRF protection, and adding rate limiting for submission attempts.\n\n6. Accessibility: The form must be keyboard navigable, include proper ARIA attributes, have sufficient color contrast, and provide clear error messages.\n\n7. Responsive design: The form should adapt to different screen sizes without compromising usability.\n\n8. Submission feedback: Clear loading states and success/error messages are needed to guide the user through the process.\n\nBased on these considerations, I'll implement a clean, step-based registration form with client-side validation and a smooth submission experience."

    },
    "expected_reasoning": "Designing a navigation system for a content-heavy web application with 5 main sections and 30+ subsections requires careful consideration of information architecture and user experience:\n\n1. Hierarchical structure: I'll organize the navigation into a clear hierarchy with the 5 main sections as primary navigation items, and their subsections as secondary items. This creates a mental model that helps users understand where they are in the application.\n\n2. Progressive disclosure: Instead of showing all 30+ subsections at once, I'll reveal them contextually when a user interacts with a main section. This reduces cognitive load.\n\n3. Navigation patterns: A combination of horizontal top navigation for main sections and a vertical sidebar for subsections would provide both breadth and depth. The sidebar could be collapsible to save space when not needed.\n\n4. Visual indicators: Clear visual cues will show the current location (active states), available paths (hover states), and previously visited areas (visited states).\n\n5. Search functionality: With this much content, a global search feature is essential to help users find specific pages without navigating the entire hierarchy.\n\n6. Breadcrumbs: Implementing breadcrumb navigation will help users understand their current location and the path taken to get there.\n\n7. Responsive considerations: On smaller screens, the navigation system could transform into a hamburger menu with expandable sections, maintaining the hierarchy while conserving space.\n\n8. Persistent access: Critical functions should remain accessible regardless of navigation state or user location within the app.\n\n9. Keyboard navigation: Ensuring the navigation system is fully accessible via keyboard with appropriate shortcuts.\n\nThis approach balances comprehensiveness with usability, preventing users from feeling overwhelmed while still providing access to all areas of the application."

    },
    "expected_reasoning": "Designing an authentication API for a mobile app with support for regular users and organization administrators requires careful consideration of several factors:\n\n1. Authentication methods: The API should support email/password login as the baseline, but also implement OAuth flows for social login options. This provides flexibility while maintaining security.\n\n2. Role-based permissions: The system needs to distinguish between regular users and organization administrators, with different permission sets. I'll implement RBAC (Role-Based Access Control) with clearly defined roles and capabilities.\n\n3. Token strategy: I'll use JWT (JSON Web Tokens) for authentication, with different token types:\n   - Short-lived access tokens (15-60 minutes)\n   - Longer-lived refresh tokens (1-7 days)\n   - This approach balances security with user convenience\n\n4. Secure endpoints:\n   - POST /auth/login for email/password authentication\n   - POST /auth/social for OAuth authentication\n   - POST /auth/refresh for obtaining new access tokens\n   - POST /auth/logout for invalidating tokens\n   - These endpoints need CSRF protection and rate limiting\n\n5. Multi-factor authentication: For increased security, especially for administrator accounts, implementing MFA is essential. The API should support verification code flows.\n\n6. Org-level permissions: Administrators need endpoints to:\n   - View all users in their organization\n   - Modify user permissions\n   - Invite new users\n   - Remove users from the organization\n\n7. API security measures: \n   - All endpoints must use HTTPS\n   - Implement proper HTTP status codes (401 for authentication failures, 403 for authorization issues)\n   - Add request throttling to prevent brute force attacks\n   - Log authentication events for audit purposes\n\n8. Mobile-specific considerations:\n   - Support for biometric authentication integration\n   - Secure storage for tokens on device\n   - Session handling for occasionally connected scenarios\n\nThis architecture provides a secure, flexible authentication system that handles the distinct needs of both user types while maintaining robust security practices."

Data categorization: I'll categorize the widgets based on their update requirements:\n   - Real-time (1-5 second updates): For critical metrics like active users or system status\n   - Near real-time (30-60 second updates): For metrics like current conversion rates or error counts\n   - Periodic (5-15 minute updates): For aggregate metrics like daily signups or revenue\n   - Static (manual refresh): For reference information or long-term trends\n\n2. Multiple fetching methods:\n   - WebSockets for true real-time widgets to maintain open connections with the server\n   - Server-Sent Events (SSE) for near real-time widgets as a more lightweight alternative to WebSockets\n   - REST API with polling for periodic updates\n   - GraphQL for complex data that may require combining multiple data sources\n\n3. Request optimization:\n   - Implement batching to combine multiple widget data requests into a single request when possible\n   - Use GraphQL to allow each widget to specify exactly what data it needs\n   - Implement request deduplication to prevent redundant calls when multiple widgets need the same data\n\n4. Caching strategy:\n   - Client-side caching with appropriate TTL (Time To Live) values based on update frequency\n   - Implement stale-while-revalidate pattern to display existing data while fetching updates\n   - Use service workers to cache dashboard data for offline or slow connection scenarios\n\n5. Loading states and error handling:\n   - Implement skeleton loaders for initial data fetch\n   - Use optimistic UI updates where appropriate\n   - Provide graceful degradation when data can't be fetched\n   - Add automatic retry logic with exponential backoff\n\n6. Performance considerations:\n   - Lazy load widgets below the fold\n   - Prioritize API requests for above-fold content\n   - Implement virtualization for dashboards with many widgets\n\n7. User control:\n   - Allow users to pause real-time updates when necessary\n   - Provide manual refresh buttons for all widgets\n\nThis multi-tiered approach ensures each widget receives data at an appropriate frequency while optimizing overall dashboard performance and resource usage."

Dependency modeling options:\n   - Option 1: Embedded approach with dependency arrays in task objects\n     - Pros: Simpler retrieval of a task with its dependencies\n     - Cons: Requires updating multiple task objects when dependencies change\n   - Option 2: Separate dependency resource\n     - Pros: Cleaner separation of concerns, easier to manage complex dependency networks\n     - Cons: Requires multiple requests to fully understand a task's dependencies\n\n4. I'll choose Option 2 for better scalability, with endpoints like:\n   - `POST /dependencies` - Create a dependency between tasks\n   - `GET /tasks/{id}/dependencies` - Get all dependencies for a task\n   - `GET /tasks/{id}/blockers` - Get tasks blocking this task\n   - `GET /tasks/{id}/dependents` - Get tasks dependent on this task\n\n5. Status management considerations:\n   - Implement validation to prevent marking tasks as complete when blockers exist\n   - Add webhook support for notifications when blocking tasks are completed\n   - Include cascade options for marking dependent tasks as blocked when a blocker is added\n\n6. Query parameters for filtering:\n   - `GET /tasks?status=pending&priority=high`\n   - `GET /lists/{id}/tasks?has_dependencies=true`\n   - `GET /tasks?blocked=true` to find tasks currently blocked\n\n7. Pagination and sorting:\n   - Implement cursor-based pagination for large lists\n   - Allow sorting by due date, priority, dependency count, etc.\n\n8. Authentication and authorization:\n   - Implement JWT authentication\n   - Add permission checks for task modification, especially for dependencies\n\nThis design creates a flexible, maintainable API that properly handles the complex relationships between tasks while adhering to RESTful principles and providing an intuitive interface for clients."

The core challenge is to help users submit valid data while minimizing friction and frustration.\n\n## Approaches\n1. **Real-time validation** - Validate as the user types or when fields lose focus\n2. **Submit-time validation** - Validate all fields only when the form is submitted\n3. **Hybrid approach** - Combine real-time validation for some fields with submit-time validation\n4. **Progressive disclosure** - Show validation rules progressively as users interact with fields\n5. **Guided validation** - Walk users through form completion step-by-step\n\n## Best Practices\n1. Validate at the appropriate time - typically on blur for most fields and on form submission\n2. Show validation messages inline near the relevant field\n3. Use clear, specific, and constructive error messages that explain how to fix the issue\n4. Indicate both valid and invalid states visually\n5. Maintain form data when errors occur - never clear the form on validation failures\n6. For complex requirements (like password rules), show requirements upfront\n7. Group related validation messages together\n8. Use appropriate input types (email, tel, number) to enable browser validation\n\n## Accessibility Considerations\n1. Ensure error messages are announced by screen readers using aria-live regions\n2. Associate error messages with form fields using aria-describedby\n3.

    "input": "What's the best approach for implementing dark mode in a web application?",
    "expected_reasoning": "## Analysis\nImplementing dark mode requires a systematic approach to color management throughout an application. The core challenge is creating a coherent visual experience across both light and dark themes while maintaining readability, accessibility, and brand consistency.\n\n## Approaches\n1. **CSS Custom Properties (Variables)** - Define color tokens that can be switched between themes\n2. **Separate CSS Files** - Load different stylesheets based on the selected theme\n3. **CSS-in-JS Solutions** - Use theme providers in styled-components, emotion, etc.\n4. **Prefers-color-scheme Media Query** - Detect system preferences automatically\n5. **Utility Class Approach** - Use utility classes like Tailwind's dark: variant\n\n## Best Practices\n1. Don't simply invert colors; create a proper dark palette considering contrast ratios\n2. Store user preferences in localStorage to maintain consistency across visits\n3. Provide an easy way to toggle between modes\n4. Respect the user's system preference as the initial default\n5. Consider using transparency/opacity to maintain color hierarchy\n6. Test color combinations for adequate contrast in both modes\n7. Avoid pure black (#000) backgrounds; use dark grays instead (e.g., #121212)\n8. Reduce overall brightness and saturation of colors in dark mode\n\n## Accessibility Considerations\n1. Maintain a minimum 4.5:1 contrast ratio for text in both modes\n2. Use a minimum 3:1 contrast ratio for UI components and graphical objects\n3. Test with screen readers to ensure theme changes are announced appropriately\n4. Check for color blindness issues in both themes\n5. Avoid relying solely on color to convey information\n6. Consider reducing motion in dark mode as some users are more sensitive to motion in dark environments\n\n## Implementation\nHere's an implementation using CSS custom properties and JavaScript:\n\n```css\n/* Define color tokens for both themes */\n:root {\n  /* Light theme (default) */\n  --color-bg-primary: #ffffff;\n  --color-bg-secondary: #f8f9fa;\n  --color-text-primary: #212529;\n  --color-text-secondary: #6c757d;\n  --color-border: #dee2e6;\n  --color-accent: #0d6efd;\n}\n\n/* Dark theme */\n[data-theme=\"dark\"] {\n  --color-bg-primary: #121212;\n  --color-bg-secondary: #1e1e1e;\n  --color-text-primary: #e9ecef;\n  --color-text-secondary: #adb5bd;\n  --color-border: #495057;\n  --color-accent: #3d99ff;\n}\n\n/* Using the theme variables */\nbody {\n  background-color: var(--color-bg-primary);\n  color: var(--color-text-primary);\n}\n\n.card {\n  background-color: var(--color-bg-secondary);\n  border: 1px solid var(--color-border);\n}\n\na {\n  color: var(--color-accent);\n}\n\n/* Also support system preference */\n@media (prefers-color-scheme: dark) {\n  :root:not([data-theme]) {\n    /* Same as [data-theme=\"dark\"] values */\n    --color-bg-primary: #121212;\n    --color-bg-secondary: #1e1e1e;\n    --color-text-primary: #e9ecef;\n    --color-text-secondary: #adb5bd;\n    --color-border: #495057;\n    --color-accent: #3d99ff;\n  }\n}\n```\n\nJavaScript for theme toggling and persistence:\n\n```javascript\nfunction setThemePreference(theme) {\n  // Update data attribute on html element\n  document.documentElement.setAttribute('data-theme', theme);\n  \n  // Store preference\n  localStorage.setItem('theme', theme);\n  \n  // Update toggle UI\n  const toggle = document.getElementById('theme-toggle');\n  if (toggle) {\n    toggle.checked = theme === 'dark';\n  }\n}\n\nfunction initTheme() {\n  // Check for stored preference\n  const storedTheme = localStorage.getItem('theme');\n  \n  if (storedTheme) {\n    // Apply stored preference\n    setThemePreference(storedTheme);\n  } else {\n    // Check system preference\n    const prefersDark = window.matchMedia('(prefers-color-scheme: dark)').matches;\n    setThemePreference(prefersDark ? 'dark' : 'light');\n  }\n  \n  // Set up listeners\n  const toggle = document.getElementById('theme-toggle');\n  if (toggle) {\n    toggle.addEventListener('change', (e) => {\n      setThemePreference(e.target.checked ? 'dark' : 'light');\n    });\n  }\n  \n  // Listen for system preference changes\n  window.matchMedia('(prefers-color-scheme: dark)').addEventListener('change', (e) => {\n    if (!localStorage.getItem('theme')) {\n      setThemePreference(e.matches ? 'dark' : 'light');\n    }\n  });\n}\n\n// Initialize theme when DOM is loaded\ndocument.addEventListener('DOMContentLoaded', initTheme);\n```\n\nIn React with a custom hook:\n\n```jsx\nfunction useDarkMode() {\n  const [theme, setTheme] = useState(() => {\n    // Check for stored preference on initial render\n    const stored = localStorage.getItem('theme');\n    if (stored) return stored;\n    \n    // Fall back to system preference\n    return window.matchMedia('(prefers-color-scheme: dark)').matches \
    ? 'dark' \
    : 'light';\n  });\n  \n  useEffect(() => {\n    // Update DOM and localStorage when theme changes\n    document.documentElement.setAttribute('data-theme', theme);\n    localStorage.setItem('theme', theme);\n  }, [theme]);\n  \n  return [theme, setTheme];\n}\n\nfunction ThemeToggle() {\n  const [theme, setTheme] = useDarkMode();\n  \n  const toggleTheme = () => {\n    setTheme(theme === 'light' ? 'dark' : 'light');\n  };\n  \n  return (\n    <button \
    onClick={toggleTheme} \
    aria-label={`Switch to ${theme === 'light' ? 'dark' : 'light'} mode`}\
    className=\"theme-toggle\"\
  >\
    {theme === 'light' ? '🌙' : '☀️'}\
  </button>\
);
}
```
\n\n## Examples\nWell-implemented dark modes can be seen on:\n- GitHub uses a dark gray rather than pure black, with carefully designed color tokens\n- VS Code has excellent dark theme implementation with syntax highlighting consideration\n- Twitter uses blue accents in both light and dark modes for brand consistency\n- Apple's ecosystem has system-wide dark mode with guidelines for developers"

    "input": "What's the best way to implement skeleton loading states?",
    "expected_reasoning": "## Analysis\nSkeleton loading states are visual placeholders that mimic the layout of content while it's being loaded. The core challenge is creating a loading experience that reduces perceived wait time, prevents layout shifts, and communicates that content is loading without causing anxiety or frustration.\n\n## Approaches\n1. **CSS-only Skeletons** - Using gradients and animations with pure CSS\n2. **Component-based Skeletons** - Creating reusable skeleton components that match content components\n3. **SVG-based Skeletons** - Using SVG shapes for more complex or precise skeleton designs\n4. **Automated Content-based Skeletons** - Generating skeletons automatically based on content structure\n5. **Progressive Loading** - Showing real content as it becomes available alongside skeletons\n\n## Best Practices\n1. Match skeletons closely to the actual content layout to minimize layout shifts\n2. Include subtle animation (like a pulse or shimmer effect) to indicate loading is in progress\n3. Use lighter colors than the background (typically gray tones) to create visual distinction\n4. Avoid overly complex animations that may draw too much attention or cause performance issues\n5. Consider embedding critical content (like headers or navigation) to load immediately\n6. Use skeletons for content that typically loads within 300ms-3s; use spinners for very quick loads and progress bars for longer operations\n7. Maintain consistent spacing and sizing between real and skeleton content\n\n## Accessibility Considerations\n1. Set appropriate ARIA attributes like `aria-busy=\"true\"` on loading containers\n2. Add appropriate role such as `role=\"status\"` to communicate loading state to screen readers\n3. Use `aria-live=\"polite\"` to announce when content has finished loading\n4. Ensure animation respects user preferences with `prefers-reduced-motion`\n5. Provide text alternatives for screen readers (e.g., \"Content is loading\")\n6. Maintain focus management when content loads\n\n## Implementation\nHere's a React component implementation for a content card skeleton:\n\n```jsx\nfunction ContentCardSkeleton({ count = 1 }) {\n  return (\n    <div \
    role=\"status\" \
    aria-live=\"polite\" \
    className=\"skeleton-container\"\
  >\
    <span className=\"sr-only\">Loading content...</span>\
    \
    {Array(count).fill().map((_, index) => (\
      <div key={index} className=\"card-skeleton\" aria-busy=\"true\">\
        <div className=\"skeleton image-skeleton\"></div>\
        <div className=\"skeleton-text\">\
          <div className=\"skeleton title-skeleton\"></div>\
          <div className=\"skeleton line-skeleton\"></div>\

  padding: 0;\
  margin: -1px;\
  overflow: hidden;\
  clip: rect(0, 0, 0, 0);\
  white-space: nowrap;\
  border-width: 0;\
}\n```\n\nTo use with a content component:\n\n```jsx\nfunction ContentList() {\n  const [items, setItems] = useState([]);\n  const [loading, setLoading] = useState(true);\n  \n  useEffect(() => {\n    fetchData()\
    .then(data => {\n      setItems(data);\
      setLoading(false);\
    })\
    .catch(error => {\n      console.error(error);\
      setLoading(false);\

    {items.map(item => (\
      <ContentCard key={item.id} item={item} />\
    ))}\
  </div>\
);
}
```\n\n## Examples\nEffective skeleton implementations can be seen on:\n- Facebook uses card skeletons for news feed items\n- LinkedIn implements skeletons for profile and post loading\n- YouTube shows video thumbnail and metadata skeletons while loading\n- Medium uses paragraph skeletons with varying widths to simulate text blocks"

    "input": "What's the best approach for implementing error handling in a React application?",
    "expected_reasoning": "## Analysis\nEffective error handling in React applications involves catching, displaying, and recovering from errors at different levels of the application. The core challenge is balancing comprehensive error management with good user experience, while ensuring developers can identify and fix issues.\n\n## Approaches\n1. **React Error Boundaries** - Use Error Boundary components to catch and handle errors in the component tree\n2. **Try/Catch Blocks** - Use traditional try/catch for handling errors in event handlers and async operations\n3. **Global Error Handling** - Implement application-wide error handlers for network requests and uncaught exceptions\n4. **Form Validation** - Handle expected input errors through validation before submission\n5. **Status-based UI** - Design UI states for loading, error, and success scenarios\n\n## Best Practices\n1. Use Error Boundaries to prevent the entire application from crashing when a component fails\n2. Create a hierarchy of Error Boundaries at different levels of your application\n3. Log errors to monitoring services for analysis and debugging\n4. Provide meaningful, user-friendly error messages that guide users on next steps\n5. Include fallback UI components that allow users to continue using other parts of the application\n6. Handle API errors separately with specific error states for different HTTP status codes\n7. Implement retry mechanisms for transient failures like network issues\n8. Don't expose sensitive stack traces or technical details to users\n\n## Accessibility Considerations\n1. Announce errors to screen readers using aria-live regions\n2. Use appropriate ARIA roles for error messages (e.g., `role=\"alert\"` for critical errors)\n3. Maintain keyboard focus on the element that triggered the error\n4. Ensure error messages have sufficient color contrast\n5. Don't rely solely on color to indicate errors\n6. Provide clear instructions on how to resolve the error\n\n## Implementation\nHere's an implementation of a React Error Boundary component:\n\n```jsx\nimport React from 'react';\nimport { logErrorToService } from '../services/errorLogging';\n\nclass ErrorBoundary extends React.Component {\n  constructor(props) {\n    super(props);\n    this.state = { hasError: false, error: null };\n  }\n\n  static getDerivedStateFromError(error) {\n    // Update state to show fallback UI\n    return { hasError: true, error };\n  }\n\n  componentDidCatch(error, errorInfo) {\n    // Log the error to an error reporting service\n    logErrorToService(error, errorInfo);\n  }\n\n  render() {\n    if (this.state.hasError) {\n      // You can render any custom fallback UI\n      return this.props.fallback || (\n        <div className=\"error-container\" role=\"alert\">\
          <h2>Something went wrong</h2>\
          <p>We're sorry, but we couldn't display this part of the page.</p>\
          <button \
            onClick={() => this.setState({ hasError: false, error: null })}\
            aria-label=\"Try again\"\
          >\
            Try Again\
          </button>\
        </div>\
      );\
    }\
\n    return this.props.children;\
  }\
}\n```\n\nUsing the Error Boundary in your app:\n\n```jsx\nfunction App() {\n  return (\n    <div className=\"app\">\
  <Header />\
  <ErrorBoundary fallback={<DashboardErrorFallback />}>\
    <Dashboard />\
  </ErrorBoundary>\
  <ErrorBoundary fallback={<GenericErrorFallback />}>\
    <UserProfile />\
  </ErrorBoundary>\
  <Footer />\
</div>\
);
}
```\n\nFor API error handling with React Query:\n\n```jsx\nimport { useQuery } from 'react-query';\nimport { fetchUserData } from '../api/user';\n\nfunction UserProfile({ userId }) {\n  const { data, error, isLoading, isError, refetch } = useQuery(\
    ['user', userId],\

    }\
  );\n\n  if (isLoading) {\n    return <LoadingSpinner aria-label=\"Loading user profile\" />;\
  }\n\n  if (isError) {\n    return (\n      <div className=\"error-state\" role=\"alert\">\
        <h3>Couldn't load your profile</h3>\
        <p>{getErrorMessage(error)}</p>\
        <button onClick={refetch} aria-label=\"Try again\">\
          Try Again\
        </button>\
      </div>\
    );
  }\n\n  return (\n    <div className=\"user-profile\">\
    <h2>{data.name}'s Profile</h2>\
    {/* Profile content */}\
  </div>\
);
}
```\n\nFor form error handling:\n\n```jsx\nimport { useState } from 'react';\nimport { useForm } from 'react-hook-form';\n\nfunction ContactForm() {\n  const [serverError, setServerError] = useState(null);\n  const { register, handleSubmit, formState: { errors } } = useForm();\n  \n  const onSubmit = async (data) => {\n    try {\n      setServerError(null);\n      const response = await fetch('/api/contact', {\n        method: 'POST',\
        headers: { 'Content-Type': 'application/json' },\

      });\n      \
      if (!response.ok) {\n        throw new Error('Form submission failed');\n      }\
      \n      // Handle success\
    } catch (err) {\n      setServerError('We couldn't send your message. Please try again.');\n      logErrorToService('Contact form submission error', { error: err });\n    }\
  };\n  \n  return (\n    <form onSubmit={handleSubmit(onSubmit)} noValidate>\
      {serverError && (\n        <div className=\"error-message\" role=\"alert\">\
          {serverError}\
        </div>\
      )}\
      \
      <div className=\"form-group\">\
        <label htmlFor=\"email\">Email</label>\
        <input \
          id=\"email\" \
          type=\"email\" \
          {...register('email', { \

            }\
          })}\
          aria-invalid={errors.email ? 'true' : 'false'}\
          aria-describedby={errors.email ? 'email-error' : undefined}\
        />\
        {errors.email && (\n          <div id=\"email-error\" className=\"field-error\" role=\"alert\">\
            {errors.email.message}\
          </div>\
        )}\
      </div>\
      \
      <button type=\"submit\">Send Message</button>\
    </form>\
  );
}
```\n\n## Examples\nEffective error handling can be seen on:\n- GitHub uses inline error messages for form validation and full-page error states for major issues\n- Google's products use material design error states with helpful recovery options\n- Stripe's dashboard provides detailed error messages with actionable steps for resolution\n- Airbnb uses friendly error messages with illustrations and clear guidance on next steps"
